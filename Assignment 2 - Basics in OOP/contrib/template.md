## Contribution

You must explain with your own words the impact of this change in your code. Your explanation must include: 

  1. what was your design before and after the change request, 
  2. what parts of the code did you change (refer to specific classes and methods). 

If your design did not change, you should justify what were the advantages of your initial design. 
Explain your design in terms of class / object responsibility. 

For instance: _"We decided to define the pokemon behaviour P in class X because of A, B or C. After the change, the responsibility of X was moved to class Y because of D, E and G."_

Your explanation must be __concise__. Therefore, it should not be longer than roughly 600 words (circa 2-3 paragraphs).
