Group Work Assignment 2 - A2-Group 29
=====================================

WORK DIVISION
    We've decided to divide the work as follows: all three members have used a version control system,
    namely, Git, to manage, track the changes and distribute the work amongst the members. For this assignment,
    we decided to work on the tasks simultaneously, using the Live Share extension in Visual Studio Code which 
    enabled us to work on the same source code at the same time. During such sessions, we, firstly, discussed the
    task scheduled for the session, and then, we started working on it collectively, wherein all members contributed
    to a certain tasks equally. The communication channel we used was Discord such that we could discuss the tasks
    and the progress of the work in real-time. Lastly, the `main` branch contains the source code provided to the 
    CodeGrade platform.

    Linked repository:
        - https://github.com/IonelPopJara/A2-G29.git

     Note: for the sake of discretion, the repository is private and can only be accessed by the members;
        however, the access may be granted upon request.

SPECIFIC TASK DIVISION
    The specific tasks that each member has been assigned are the following:
        - Ionel, Joel, Michal: work on the assignment in a Live Share sessions with the other members, discussion
            and implementation of the tasks based on the requirements of the assignment;

    Individual contributions:
        - Ionel: contributed to `getEffectiveValue()` method in `PokemonUtils.java`, implementation of a matrix
            data structure to represent the effectiveness of the types of the Pokemons' attacks (described by 
            a table in the assignment); contributed to the refactoring of the source code - generalization and reusable
            code was the main focus of the refactoring process.

        - Joel: contributed to the refactoring of the source code with analysis on the code quality and performance
            of the behaviors of the objects in the source code. Came up with the idea of using an Utilities Class
            to facilitate the reusability of methods. Proposed the idea of using a binary search algorithm in the
            `ItemBag.java` class - created a pseudo-code for the algorithm's implementation.

        - Michal: managed the version control system (Git) as the fundamental tool for the work distribution and
            tracking of the changes in the source code; contributed to the refactoring of the source code in order 
            to improve the code quality and performance of the behaviors of the objects in the source code. Provided
            comments in the source code to explain the functionality of the methods, etc. Proposed and implemented 
            the binary search algorithm in the `ItemBag.java`.
