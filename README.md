I attended this course in `August - October 2022` and coded in a group with 2 other students. In this course, we were given 3 assignments (the ones visible in this repository) and an exam.

## Future Applications

In a vast multitude of projects after this course are based on the knowledge that I gained in this course. As this course went into the fundamentals of Java and how objects, inheritance, polymorhpism, properties and writing to files can be leveraged, I was prepared to extend these abstract concepts into implemented code in the following projects:
